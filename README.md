# Interactive Web Development Showcase

This project is an interactive showcase of web development technologies, demonstrating the progression from HTML to CSS to JavaScript. 

It was created using React with TypeScript and Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with animations and interactive elements.

## Created with Bolt
This project was created using [Bolt](https://bolt.new/), an AI-powered development assistant.

Bolt utilized a React with TypeScript template as the starting point. It then incrementally built the project by creating and modifying key files such as App.tsx, index.css, and package.json. 

The AI assistant implemented the core functionality, including the view progression logic, code display, and interactive elements like the typewriter effect and restart button. Bolt also set up the project structure, added necessary dependencies, and configured tools like ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and Vite for optimal development and build processes. 

Throughout the creation process, Bolt adhered to best practices in React development, TypeScript usage, and modern web design principles, resulting in a fully functional and visually appealing interactive web development showcase.

## Viewing the Project

This project serves as both a learning tool and a demonstration of modern web development techniques, showcasing the power and interactivity possible with current web technologies.

## Project Overview

The application cycles through four main views:

1. HTML view
2. CSS view
3. JavaScript view
4. Final view (combining all three)

Each view demonstrates a specific aspect of web development, with code examples and visual representations.

## Requirements

1. **View Progression:**
   - Automatically progress through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript views.
   - Each view is displayed for 2 seconds before moving to the next.
   - Users can manually progress using a next button.

2. **Code Display:**
   - Each view shows relevant code snippets.
   - Code is displayed in a styled block with syntax highlighting.

3. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Footer with a next button (right arrow icon) for manual progression.
   - Next button has a hover effect with gradient coloring and glow.

4. **Final View:**
   - Displays all three examples (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in one row.
   - Includes a restart button to refresh the page.

5. **Typewriter Effect:**
   - Applied to the 'Hello, JS!' title in the JavaScript and Final views.
   - In the Final view, the typewriter effect restarts every 2 seconds.

6. **Responsive Design:**
   - Layouts adjust for different screen sizes.
   - Utilizes Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.

7. **Animations:**
   - Fade-in and slide-up animations for view transitions.
   - Gradient animations for buttons and text effects.

8. **Accessibility:**
   - Semantic HTML structure.
   - Keyboard navigable interface.

9. **Performance:**
   - Efficient React component structure.
   - Optimized for smooth animations and transitions.

10. **Code Quality:**
    - TypeScript for type safety.
    - ESLint for code linting.
    - Modular and reusable component structure.
